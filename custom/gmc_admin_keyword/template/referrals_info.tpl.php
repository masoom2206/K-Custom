					<p>* You may present your unique link openly at youtube etc - however bare in mind that if your friend decides to sign up at a later occasion via the normal GMC sign up page - the system will not be able to track the sign up.<br><br>Instead, we recommend that you encourage people to get in personal contact with you (msn, e-mail, etc) - as this is the most effective way to refer people.</p>
